# Nitroapp (untis-api)
A Python Wrapper for the Untis API

To use this API, simply create an `.env` file such as `.env.example` shows and add your credentials to it.<br>
Then run `main.py` in `/src/` and the script will get your Untis timetable and save it as `timetable.json` in `/out/`.<br><br>
This API is designed to work with Whatsapp alerts. You may replace that part with whatever you want to do with your timetable.<br><br>
